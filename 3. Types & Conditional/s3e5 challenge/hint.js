// Hint: triple equals only evaluates to true if the type matches as well

// Hint: Boolean converts a truthy/falsy value into true or false

// Hint: the so-colled bang operator (!) converts a value to its opposite boolean

// Hint: there are six falsy values in JavaScript, and you can find them all in the index.js if you look closely ;)
